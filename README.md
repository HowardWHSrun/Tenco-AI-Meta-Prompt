# Tenco-AI-Meta-Prompt

This repository contains a single file: `Tenco AI Meta Prompt.md`. It is a turnkey, copy‑paste meta prompt that transforms a general AI assistant into a specialized Tenco technical writing assistant that enforces the Tenco Style Guide.

## What it is
- A comprehensive prompt that:
  - Displays a mandatory professional responsibility warning first
  - Asks targeted intake questions
  - Provides structured section prompts and examples
  - Enforces active voice, precise terminology, and formatting rules
  - Prevents common writing errors (e.g., passive voice, vague language)
  - Implements a fallback protocol when iterations stall

## How to use
1. Open `Tenco AI Meta Prompt.md`.
2. Select all and copy the entire content.
3. Paste into your AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as the first message in a new chat.
4. The AI will:
   - Show the mandatory reminder first
   - Ask you intake questions (document type, audience, data)
   - Let you pick sections (Introduction, Methodology, Results, etc.)
   - Generate copy-ready content in clean, structured blocks
5. Provide your actual project data when prompted. The prompt requires placeholders where real numbers/details are missing.

## Writing standards enforced
- Active voice with explicit actors ("Tenco engineers performed...")
- Preservation of exact figure/table/section references
- Precise regulatory citations and units
- Professional formatting and consistent terminology
- Copyable outputs suitable for Word

## Safety and responsibility
- The meta prompt emphasizes that AI supports writing and formatting only.
- You must verify all technical content, calculations, and compliance claims.

## Notes
- If results are not right after 2–3 iterations, the prompt includes a built-in fallback offering alternate approaches or model switching with a context handoff.
- You can adjust tone and audience preferences at the start of a session.
