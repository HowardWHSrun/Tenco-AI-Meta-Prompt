Without detailed information about the rolling stock, traction power substations and track circuits, Tenco can't estimate this scope at this time.\n\nEither Tenco or the Traction Power supplier must take steps necessary to demonstrate compliance with IEEE Std 519, including utility coordination, coordination with the Rolling Stock supplier, analysis of utility point of common coupling (PCC) impacts, and assessment and adjustment of OCS network parameters.\n\nTenco has deep experience performing these tasks for the Penisula Corridor Electrification Project (PCEP) for the San Jose -  San Francisco segment of the CAHSR routes.  Tenco will plan, estimate, and propose this scope when information is available to allow planning and estimating. See assumption #10 below.
