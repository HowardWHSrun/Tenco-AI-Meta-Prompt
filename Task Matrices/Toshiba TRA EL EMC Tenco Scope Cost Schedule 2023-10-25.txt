1          NaN  Turner Engineering Corporation (Tenco), October 25, 2023\nTerms:  Tenco proposes to perform the work on a time and material rate, at our engineering service rates in effect at the time.\nThis proposal represents Tenco's estimated level of effort to support the schedule of activities provided by TISS.  Tenco will bill for actual time and materials.\nFactors outside of Tenco's control can affect the actual level of effort.\nTenco will stop work when the amount of TISS PO is reached, therefore TISS should include contingency funding above this estimate to prevent work interruption.

Witness the TISS Factory Test and provide direction.  Tenco assumes 9 available hours of testing on test track for each day at TISS Factory. Limited  access to track or difficult testing conditions that reduce available testing hours may require more test days than estimated.\n\nRefer to "TISS Fuchu Factory EMI Test Schedule" for the daily activity.\n\nThe test is 5 working days plus 2 contingency days. Tenco test plan requires 3 test engineers. Tenco assumes 11 hour days for test engineers for each day of factory test consisting of 1/2 hour morning meeting + 9 hours testing + 1/2 hour daily wrap-up meeting + 1 hour daily data review.\n\nTwo contingency days are included in the base schedule for ordinary contingencies, based on Tenco's past experience.\n\nFactors outside of Tenco's control may cause additional test delay.  Examples of such factors include:\n* Locomotive not operable\n* Test track power or rail condition does not allow for test runs to be made\n* Interference from JR trains invalidates test runs\n\nTenco budget estimate assumes full engineering test. Estimate assumes TRA witness will be present during full engineering test. A separate witness test may require more test days and affect scope estimate.  Estimate assumes TISS provides translator staff for factory tests. \n\nNote:  Travel between US and Japan assumes Premium Economy rate, or if unavailable, Business Class.  Travel within Japan assumes Shinkansen ordinary car, reserved seat.\n\nTenco budget does not include Magnetic Field Tests at TISS Factory because low test speeds mean low power thus low Magnetic Field readings.
