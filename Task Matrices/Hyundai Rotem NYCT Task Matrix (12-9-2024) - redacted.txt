Factors outside of Tenco's control can affect the actual level of effort.\nTenco will inform Hyundai Rotem of any condition which will cause the actual effort to exceed the estimate for that portion of the work.

The Loan Agreement uses the word "plan" where "procedure" seems more consistent with the R160 TS terms.  We suggest asking for clarification.\n\nRegardless, Tenco suggests that an top-level APS Loan Agreement Test Plan should define test deliverables and expectations.
