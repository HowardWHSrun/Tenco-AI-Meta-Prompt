The CEMIPS shall be designed with an equipment safety and integrity level as required in the EMI Safety Analysis. If the EMI Detector prevents the HSCB from closing, then this shall be indicated to the MDS. A bypass switch shall permit closure of the HSCB and its action shall also impose a vehicle speed limit."\n  Note: TS 2.5.2.11-6 mentions an EMI Safety Analysis, but the TS does not explicitly require an ESA as a CDRL.\n\nAssumption: Tenco writes the car-level ESA,.  Tenco states ESA requirements for system suppliers.\n\nNote: Since EMC depends mostly on Propulsion and APS, Tenco recommends that KI/Tenco prepare a car-level ESA covering train, railcar, Propulsion, APS, and ATC EMI hazards.

Increased cost.\n     * If docs required too late: Rush job, requires higher rate labor. Increased cost.

This proposal assumes that the track circuit design entirely fulfills the criterion 1N 2.8.o.4:  "Track circuit testing is not required for track circuits that utilize pre-approved track relays and matching transformers."  \n\nThe ESCA will check all in-scope track circuit final design plans, and will report the results.  If the results show that all track circuits are a better case than the NYCT worst-case track circuits, the ESCA will conclude that no track circuit tests are required per 1N 2.8.o.\n\nIf the design includes track circuits that do not comprise a better case than the NYCT worst-case track circuit, analysis, test procedure, test, and report work will be an added scope and cost task.

As noted in the ESCA, this proposal assumes that the track circuit design entirely fulfills the criterion 1N 2.8.o.4:  "Track circuit testing is not required for track circuits that utilize pre-approved track relays and matching transformers."  \n\nThe ESCA will check all in-scope track circuit final design plans, and will report the results.  If the results show that all track circuits are a better case than the NYCT worst-case track circuits, the ESCA will conclude that no track circuit tests are required per 1N 2.8.o.\n\nIf the design includes track circuits that do not comprise a better case than the NYCT worst-case track circuit, analysis, test procedure, test, and report work will be an added scope and cost task.

As noted in the ESCA, this proposal assumes that the track circuit design entirely fulfills the criterion 1N 2.8.o.4:  "Track circuit testing is not required for track circuits that utilize pre-approved track relays and matching transformers."  \n\nThe ESCA will check all in-scope track circuit final design plans, and will report the results.  If the results show that all track circuits are a better case than the NYCT worst-case track circuits, the ESCA will conclude that no track circuit tests are required per 1N 2.8.o.\n\nIf the design includes track circuits that do not comprise a better case than the NYCT worst-case track circuit, analysis, test procedure, test, and report work will be an added scope and cost task.

"Pre-printed survey and measurement forms shall be developed and included in each section of the EMI/EMC Compliance Program. The forms shall include spaces for: readings, room designation, station name, engineering stationing, track number, peak or off-peak time, signatures of tester and persons witnessing testing, serial number of equipment used and all other pertinent information, as directed by the Engineer. The completed forms shall be submitted ten days after the tests are completed." - TS 1N.2.11.e\n\n"A complete description and catalog cuts for all test equipment, meters, chart recorders, laboratory testing equipment and all other instrumentation used for the field surveys, measurement testing and laboratory tests, shall be submitted as part of the overall EMI/EMC Compliance Program. All current certificates of calibration shall also be included in the submittal." - TS 1N.2.11.g\n\nNote: TS 1N.2.11.g requires information such catalog cuts for test equipment, meters, chart recorders and other lab and field testing equipment.  Tenco will not know most of this information before performing EMI tests, but it will be included in Report appendices.
